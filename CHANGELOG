## v1.2.0 (2019-06-17)

### major: change backing store to @fatlama/fl-secretsmanager-caching

Previously every call for a secret resulted in a call to the AWS Secrets Manager API, which is excessive given the read-heavy
nature of fetching secret values. v1.2.0 adds the Secrets Manager caching layer to cache secrets for up to a maximum time period
(default: max 1 hour) before refreshing the list of VersionStages and VersionIds.
